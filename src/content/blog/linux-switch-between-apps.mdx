### How to use Super + number keys to switch between your favourite apps in pop OS

1. Remove the overridden hotkeys:

`sudo vim /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/50_pop-session.gschema.override`
Comment out the switch-to-application-n lines:

```bash
# switch-to-application-1 = []
# switch-to-application-2 = []
# switch-to-application-3 = []
# switch-to-application-4 = []
# switch-to-application-5 = []
# switch-to-application-6 = []
# switch-to-application-7 = []
# switch-to-application-8 = []
# switch-to-application-9 = []
```

2. Recompile glib schema:

`sudo /usr/bin/glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/` 3. Log out and in again.

Enjoy.
