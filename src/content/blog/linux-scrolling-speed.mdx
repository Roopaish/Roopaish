### How to control scrolling speed in Pop OS or Ubuntu?

1. List the Id's and look for 'ELAN1200: ...' or anything with touchpad mentioned :

`xinput list`

2. Grab the ID and List the properties for this ID (eg: 14) :

`xinput list-props 14`

3. Set the value of the property "libinput Scrolling Pixel Distance" to 50, you can change this value by default is 15, if the value is bigger the acceleration is slower:

`sudo xinput set-prop 14 "libinput Scrolling Pixel Distance" 50`

4. To not lose the effect when you startup the device

- Create .xsessionrc file in the Home directory (`nvim ~/.xsessionrc`)
- Add content: `xinput set-prop 14 "libinput Scrolling Pixel Distance" 50`

Tips: Use fast scroll chrome extension to scroll fast on the webpage by pressing alt key using the touchpad (as inertial scrolling does not work on all apps, it will help), Vscode also has a option to use fast scroll using Alt key
